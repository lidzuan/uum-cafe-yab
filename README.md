Coded in VB.NET and using Microsoft Access, this project was completed for "SQIT3043 Data Modeling and Database" in early 2022. The attached PDF contains the full project report.

## Project Description

UUM Cafe YAB is an application that provides functionalities for dine-in, take-away, and delivery, offering a convenient and efficient way for UUM residents to enjoy delicious food from Cafe YAB while adhering to social distancing measures during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Customers can choose to dine in, take away, or place delivery orders from anywhere within UUM, reducing the risk of infection and maintaining social distancing. They may enter promo codes to apply discount on orders. The project implements a robust database system that records UUM residents' details, orders, sales, and employee information, streamlining management processes. The program integrates Crystal Reports to display order payments made by customers directly from the database.

For customers, the system provides a user-friendly interface to make orders, review menus, apply discount codes, and make online reservations for dine-in and take-out. Staff members can add, edit, view, and filter customer information, orders, payments, promo codes, revenue, and employee and delivery boy performance. Delivery riders can log in to view pending deliveries assigned to them, confirm delivery orders, and track their performance.
